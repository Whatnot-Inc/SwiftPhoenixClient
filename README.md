## About
SwiftPhoenixClient is a Swift port of phoenix.js, allowing your swift projects
to connect to a Phoenix Websocket backend.

We try out best to keep the library up to date with phoenix.js but if there is
something that is missing, please create an issue or, even better,  a PR to
address the change.

## Sample Projects

You can view the example of how to use SwiftPhoenixClient in the Example/ dir.
There are two primary classes, `BasicViewController` and `ChatRoomViewController`.
The `BasicViewController` is designed to test against a [local chat server](https://github.com/chrismccord/phoenix_chat_example)
where as `ChatRoomViewController` is a more "complete" example which targets
dwyl's [phoenix-chat-example](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-chat-example) Heroku app.


### SwiftPhoenixClient

The core module which provides the Phoenix Channels and Presence logic. It also
uses URLSession's default WebSocket implementation which has a minimum iOS target
of 13.0.


## Installation

### CocoaPods

You can install SwiftPhoenix Client via CocoaPods by adding the following to your
Podfile. Keep in mind that in order to use Swift Phoenix Client, the minimum iOS
target must be '9.0'

```RUBY
pod "SwiftPhoenixClient", '~> 5.2'
```

and running `pod install`. From there you will need to add `import SwiftPhoenixClient` in any class you want it to be used.

### Carthage

If you use Carthage to manage your dependencies, simply add
SwiftPhoenixClient to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "davidstump/SwiftPhoenixClient" ~> 5.2
```

Then run `carthage update`.

If this is your first time using Carthage in the project, you'll need to go through some additional steps as explained [over at Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application).



### SwiftPackageManager

_Note: Instructions below are for using **SwiftPM** without the Xcode UI. It's the easiest to go to your Project Settings -> Swift Packages and add SwiftPhoenixClient from there._

To integrate using Apple's Swift package manager, without Xcode integration, add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/davidstump/SwiftPhoenixClient.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "5.2.2"))
```

and then specify `"SwiftPhoenixClient"` as a dependency of the Target in which you wish to use SwiftPhoenixClient.


## Usage

Using the Swift Phoenix Client is extremely easy (and familiar if you have used the phoenix.js client).

See the [Usage Guide](https://github.com/davidstump/SwiftPhoenixClient/wiki/Usage-Guide) for details instructions. You can also check out the [documentation](http://davidstump.github.io/SwiftPhoenixClient/)


## Example

Check out the [ViewController](https://github.com/davidstump/SwiftPhoenixClient/blob/master/Examples/Basic/chatroom/ChatRoomViewController.swift) in this repo for a brief example of a simple iOS chat application using the [Phoenix Chat Example](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-chat-example)

Also check out both the Swift and Elixir channels on IRC.
